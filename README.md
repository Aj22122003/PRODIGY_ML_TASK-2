K-means Clustering for Customer Segmentation This repository demonstrates K-means clustering for customer segmentation based on their annual income and spending score.
Overview K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into a specified number of clusters. In this project, we apply K-means clustering to segment customers based on two features: 1.Annual Income: The annual income of customers. 2.Spending Score: A score assigned to customers based on their spending behavior. The dataset used here is synthetic and consists of 20 customer records.
Files: Task_2.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python script for data preprocessing, K-means clustering, and visualization. Customer.csv: CSV file containing the generated customer dataset used for clustering.
Libraries Used: pandas: Data manipulation and analysis. scikit-learn: Machine learning library for the K-means algorithm. matplotlib: Visualization library for plotting the clusters.
